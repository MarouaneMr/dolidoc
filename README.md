# Dolidoc (Frontend)

Dolidoc is a cross-platform doctor appointment and calendar management application designed for clinics and doctors to streamline bookings, notifications, and profile handling. This repository contains the **frontend-only** codebase built in **TypeScript** and **React Native/Expo**, organized to demonstrate code quality and architecture for academic and professional review.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This repository contains only the publicly shareable portion of the application — the **frontend code** — for thesis and code review purposes. The **complete production app**, including backend services and sensitive logic, is under review and pending approval for deployment on the **App Store** and **Google Play Store**. That full source code is private.
